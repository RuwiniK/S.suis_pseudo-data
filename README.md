# Streptococcus suis pseudo-dataset

This repository contains a pseudo-dataset representing virulome profiles and pathotype classifications for Streptococcus suis isolates. The dataset has been anonymized and limited to 20 pseudo-isolates to protect sensitive and proprietary information, while preserving the structure and format of the original dataset.

This repository accompanies the Start-Up Application 2026:

Project Title: Decoding virulence: uncovering signatures in Streptococcus suis

Dataset Description
* Virulome Profiles: Presence (1) or absence (0) data for 58 virulence-associated genes (VAGs).
  
* Pathotype Classification: Each isolate is labeled as either P (Putatively Pathogenic) or PC (Potentially Commensal).
  
* Number of Isolates: 20 pseudo-sample isolates.

Note: This pseudo-dataset is provided for methodological review purposes only. It does not contain real or identifiable data from third-party contributors.
